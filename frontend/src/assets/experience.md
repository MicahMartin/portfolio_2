I specialize in building web services focused on performance, scalability, and reliability. I also create networking, rendering and gameplay systems for game engines. Below is a selection of my work, most of which has been on The Boston Globe & my indie game project - Beatdown. This isn't everything I've worked on, just a some of the stuff I thought was cool. If you feel like I could help you with a project, heres my email :D I'm also on Linkedin & Github.
